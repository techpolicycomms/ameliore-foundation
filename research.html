        <h1>Call for Research Proposals</h1>
        <p>Ameliore Foundation is inviting researchers and documentary filmmakers to submit proposals for a project focusing on the environmental degradation in North Bihar, particularly in the agricultural sector. The selected proposal will be awarded a cash prize of INR 1,50,001.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Our agricultural lands, especially in our village and its surroundings, are facing severe degradation due to the large number of brick kilns. These kilns have stripped major parts of the agricultural land of their surface soils, rendering them barren. The extraction of soil for brick-making has caused significant harm to the agricultural sector. Additionally, the smoke emitted from the kilns is damaging and killing small insects vital for grain, pulse, and mango production.</p>

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>We aim to conduct comprehensive research and create a compelling documentary film that highlights these issues. We believe that this will draw attention to the problem at local, national, and international levels, and inspire action towards sustainable solutions.</p>

        <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
        <p>Interested researchers and filmmakers are invited to submit their proposals detailing their approach, methodology, and timeline for the project. Please include any relevant previous work or experience.</p>
