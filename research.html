            <h2>Research Call 1: Midwifery Services in Rural Areas</h2>
            <p>Midwifery Services in Rural Areas:
We have observed a significant gap in the availability of midwifery services in rural areas. Traditional services are dwindling, and government provisions are not reaching all sections of society. We are interested in research that explores:

The current state of midwifery services in rural areas.
The impact of this gap on women's health and childbirth outcomes.
Potential solutions, such as training local women to serve as nurses in their communities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="research-call">
            <h2>Research Call 2: Education and Learning Opportunities</h2>
            <p>Education facilities are lacking in rural areas, particularly for students up to class 12. We are interested in research that explores:

The current state of education in rural areas, particularly in the Basopatti Block of Madhubani district.
The impact of this lack of facilities on student outcomes.
Potential solutions, such as remote learning or coaching programs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="research-call">
            <h2>Research Call 3: Modern Agricultural Practices</h2>
            <p>Small land farmers and cultivators in rural areas could benefit from the use of modern tools, equipment, and soil testing facilities. We are interested in research that explores:

The current state of agricultural practices in rural areas.
The impact of these practices on crop yields and farmer income.
Potential solutions, such as rental programs for modern farming equipment and soil testing facilities.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Contact</h2>

        <h2>Deadline</h2>
        <p>We invite researchers to submit proposals that address these issues. Successful proposals will clearly outline the research question, methodology, expected outcomes, and potential impact on rural communities. Please submit your proposal by 31 March 2024</p>

        <h2>Invest in Purposeful Causes</h2>
